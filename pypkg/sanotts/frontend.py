"""Text -> Piper phoneme-id frontend.

Mirrors the exact algorithm used by ``piper.phonemize_espeak`` /
``piper.phoneme_ids`` (see the upstream piper1-gpl project) without
depending on the ``piper-tts`` package itself (that package pulls in
onnxruntime as a hard dependency and expects a full ONNX voice to be
loaded before it will phonemize anything).

Instead we drive the same underlying espeak-ng shared library through
``phonemizer-fork`` + ``espeakng-loader``, then apply the exact
NFD-decompose-to-codepoints and ``phonemes_to_ids`` framing rules that
piper uses. This has been verified byte-for-byte against
``piper.voice.PiperVoice.phonemize`` / ``.phonemes_to_ids`` for
representative English sentences (see the package's gate test) -- the
key ingredients are ``with_stress=True``, ``tie=False``,
``preserve_punctuation=True`` (with piper's own punctuation set) and
``language_switch="remove-flags"``, plus a final ``rstrip()`` before
NFD decomposition (phonemizer emits a trailing space that piper does
not).

Known espeakng-loader pitfall (see project memory): some published
``espeakng-loader`` wheels report a data path via
``get_data_path()`` that looks valid on disk but the bundled dylib
silently ignores it and falls back to a baked-in build-time path from
the wheel's CI runner (e.g.
``/Users/runner/work/espeakng-loader/.../espeak-ng-data``), which does
not exist on the end user's machine. We defend against this by
actually trying to construct a working backend for each data-path
candidate (loader path, then common system install locations) instead
of trusting ``os.path.exists`` alone.
